# pyREM

pyREM is a Python library containing some useful classes and functions that enable the user (primarily myself)
to build radio telescopes, uv-coverages, covariance matrices etc. to study the impact of calibration systematics
on Epoch of Reionisation experiments aiming to measure the 21-cm Power Spectrum.
